Developer with 6+ years of professional working experience and few more unofficially xD. I have been on a mix path with great exposure to both Software Development and Entrepreneurship.

Pre-Professional Journey [since everyone has a story to tell..]
- I like to build tools and softwares to solve real-world problems, back in college days I tried to start my own venture - C.L.A.Y - to connect people locally based on their location to solve the issue of disconnect the modern world has introduced in each one of our lives.
Since then I've worked on several interesting projects - making an IoT enabled Women Safety App (for which I've patent), to making an affordable version of Digital Hearing Aid in-collaboration with AIIMS Raipur [ a premier medical institution in India].
- I have also been part of several startup pitch rounds and also have my hands on talking and thinking about GTM, Marketing, Fund Rounds when I started my venture.

Fast Forward to today...
- I did a short stint at Deloitte (great culture and company) but the professional goals did not align with my personal goals.
- Switched to Geospatial company - one of the few devs who have experience with working on Maps, Geocoders, Routing and also worked on writing an algorithm to back-trace cell or wifi tower location using logs from Trucks with IoT without using GPS.
- My fate again led me to another Geospatial company, this time I went beyond Earth to solve the problems - I worked in SpaceTech - Edge computing in Satellites wherein I was solving complex backend problems in Earth Observation, Remote Sensing and making ML/AI models work on Satellites in real-time, sounds crazy right? Feel free to connect with me if you would like to talk more about this.
- Over the years, I realized one thing - hiring and getting hired both are tough, hence now I work to make that part easier - working as Senior Software Developer in hiring space to make efficient tools to hire the right talent for the given job.

## üî≠ I'm currently working on

- **Agentic AI** - Exploring building Voice Agents for pre-sales, and other small inter-connected agents to support and fasten the process of Hiring the right candidate for a given organization.
- **Data Engineering** - Building large-scale ETL pipelines to ingest data from different ATS/LMS sources.
- **Indexes** - Working on large scale indexes with Azure SearchAI to scan through million of documents and writing pipelines to normalize the data within such indexes.

## üå± I'm currently learning

- **GenAI and MCP** - Deepening my understanding of modern state of the art of the technologies to create better products.
- **Cloud Technologies** - Exploring AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms
- **Dsitributed Systems** - Learning the why and case studies behind few of the popular large scale processing systems, working on Spark and Storm to understand large-scale batch and real-time processing.

## ü§ù I'm looking to collaborate on

- **Open Source Projects** - Particularly in backend, AI, and developer tools - with domains in Geospatial, large-scale distributed systems.
- **Innovative Applications** - Projects that solve real-world problems
